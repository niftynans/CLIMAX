# CLIMAX
This repository holds code for replicating experiments in the paper titled, 'CLIMAX -- An exploration of Classifier Based Explanations', where CLIMAX stands for Contrastive Label-Aware Influence-Based Model Agnostic XAI. It is built on the implementation of LIME as well as SLIME with added functions.

## Introduction
It has been shown that post hoc explanations based on perturbations (such as LIME) exhibit large instability, posing serious challenges to the effectiveness of the method itself and harming user trust. Our method, CLIMAX not only justifies the output class of an input, but also what should be absent to maintain the original classification. It provides us with the insight of why a point must lie in a particular class, while also explainaing why it shouldn't lie in another class.

## Usage
Our Method Supports all types of data -- Tabular, Textual, and Image-Based.
